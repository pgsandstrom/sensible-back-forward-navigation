# sensible-back-forward-navigation

## DEPRECATED!

DEPRECATED! This extension is deprecated and unpublished from the visual studio marketplace. Vscode finally improved their back- and forward-navigation and this extension is now redundant.

## Presentation

This extension aims to improve vscode 'go back' and 'go forward' commands. I dislike how vscode saves each minor movement, even just one character to the side, in the movement history. This extension aims to group these movement in a sensible way.

The default keybinding is alt+h and alt+l, since I am a huge fan of vim. But you can change this to your liking, ofcourse.

This is still a still not v1.0, since I'm trying different approaches and have not settled on exactly how this extension will work. But I consider it to be very usable, so do go ahead and install it :)
