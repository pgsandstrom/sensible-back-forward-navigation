# sensible-back-forward-navigation

This extension aims to improve vscode 'go back' and 'go forward' commands. I dislike how vscode saves each minor movement, even just one character to the side, in the movement history. This extension aims to group these movement in a sensible way.

The default keybinding is alt+h and alt+l, since I am a huge fan of vim. But you can change this to your liking, ofcourse.

WARNING: This is a very early release, bound to be buggy and unpolished.
